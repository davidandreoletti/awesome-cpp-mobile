# Awesome build scripts for C/C++ projects targeting mobile environments [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome build scripts to compile C/C++ libraries for mobile environments (eg: iOS, Android, etc). 

At the moment, build script based support for building those C/C++ projects's binaries for mobile devices is seriously lacking,
individuals have therefore wrote their own scripts yet they are hard to discover. Hence this list.

If you are looking for a curated list of c++ frameworks, libraries, resources and shiny things, [awesome-cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) is what you are looking for.

If you know a list similar to that one or more "awesome", let me know. I did look around and could have missed it (24/09/2015)!
